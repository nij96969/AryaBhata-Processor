Description:
A Central Processing Unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the most important processor in a given computer. Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling.
Here we have implemented central processing unit that performs operations according to the given instructions rapidly. Speed and efficiency both have been considered.
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) implemented is a digital circuit that can execute instructions stored in memory. It consists of various components such as registers, an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), a control unit, and data and control lines that connect them(Common Bus). The instruction set is defined by the designer, and the CPU performs operations such as arithmetic, logic, and control flow.

In order to start the CPU you have click the pin in order to start the execution and close it simultaneously when the D Flip Flop sets to 1.
